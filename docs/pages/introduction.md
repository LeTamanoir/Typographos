## Why Typographos?

Tired of manually writing TypeScript interfaces that mirror your PHP DTOs?

Frustrated when your frontend types get out of sync with backend changes?

Typographos automatically generates TypeScript declarations from your PHP classes with just one attribute. No configuration files, no complex setup, no maintenance overhead. Your types stay in sync because they're generated directly from your PHP source code.
